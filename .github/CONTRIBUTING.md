### Reporting Bugs and getting help

The issue tracker on Github is for bug reports only. It is not a general support forum.

**A bug is everything you can reproduce. ie *if I do this that happens but something else should happen instead*.**

Please search the issue tracker (including closed issues). Your bug might be a server bug that has already been addressed.

Please fill in the template when creating new issues and provide information about your device and your server. The [adb logcat](https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Doc:_debugging_with_logcat) can be omitted if you can reproduce the bug under every condition. (ie *click button X and the application crashes*) But the adb logcat is required if the bug happens only under certain conditions or involves network problem (Server not found, messages not arriving) 

**If you are seeking help or are unable to reproduce the exact problem please join our MUC at conversations@conference.siacs.eu**
